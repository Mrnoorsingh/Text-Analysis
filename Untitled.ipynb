markets with a number of wellestablished united states and foreign companies on the basis of various strengths depending on the country product category and distribution channels. the company believes that it is wellpositioned to pursue continued growth as a result of several competitive strengths which include the following distribution network. the company has one of the premier mass merchant distribution networks serving large national retailers in the united states. the company also has a strong network of wellestablished distributors and service organizations in latin america. the company supports its customers needs with strong warehousing and distribution capabilities a broad highquality product portfolio electronic data interchange edi and justintime product delivery capabilities. the company markets its products through virtually every category of retailer including mass merchandisers catalog showrooms warehouse clubs department stores catalogues companyowned outlet stores television shopping channels hardware stores home improvement centers drug and grocery stores and pet supply retailers as well as independent distributors and military post exchange outlets. strong position in consolidating retail environment. the consolidation trend in the retail industry has resulted in the emergence and global expansion of large mass merchandisers that demand financially strong efficient suppliers which offer a broad range of innovative quality products with the ability to make timely shipments in large volumes and provide strong customer promotional and merchandising support. the company has benefited from this trend and believes it has the opportunity to further expand distribution with a number of retailers and increase its penetration of existing accounts. in the company sold products to virtually all of the top u.s. retailers including walmart price costco kmart target stores home depot sears roebuck co. service merchandise menards lowe's and j.c. penney. brand name recognition. the sunbeamregistered trademark and osterregistered trademark brands have been household names for generations. the company believes that these brands along with its other wellknown secondary names such as mixmasterregistered trademark and osterizerregistered trademark draw customers into retail stores specifically to purchase products bearing these brand names. during the past year the company has spent over million for advertising and sales promotion to support brand recognition. market leadership. the majority of sunbeam sales are from products in which the company holds the number one or two market share position. the company believes that this combination of leading brandname products and breadth of product offerings makes sunbeam an attractive vendor to retailers who are consolidating their suppliers. customers the rapid growth of large mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs and changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant consolidation of the u.s. retail industry and the formation of dominant multicategory retailers. sunbeam has positioned itself to respond to the challenges of this changing retail environment by pursuing strategic relationships with large highvolume merchandisers. the company markets its products through virtually every category of retailer including mass merchandisers catalog showrooms warehouse clubs department stores hardware stores catalogues television shopping channels home centers drug and grocery stores and pet supply retailers as well as independent distributors and the military post exchange services. the company's largest customer walmart stores inc. accounted for approximately of sales in . retailers are pursuing a number of strategies in their competition to deliver the highestquality lowestcost brand name products. a growing trend among retailers is to purchase on a justintime basis in order to reduce inventory costs and increase returns on investment. this trend has required increased working capital investments for manufacturers and requires manufacturers to more closely monitor consumer buying patterns as retailers shorten their lead times for orders. currently most sunbeam products sold to u.s. retailers are manufactured at the company's own facilities in north america. however one of the company's goals for is to source approximately fifty percent of parts andor products from others including suppliers in asia in order to reduce capital investment in plants while growing sales volume and to improve operating margins. the company intends to continue to support its retail partners' justintime inventory strategies through investments in among other things improved forecasting systems more responsive manufacturing and distribution capabilities and electronic communications. currently sunbeam has approximately of its u.s. customer sales on electronic data interchange edi systems. the amount of backlog orders at any point in time is not a significant factor in the company's business. patents and trademarks sunbeam believes that an integral part of its strength is its ability to capitalize on the sunbeamregistered trademark and osterregistered trademark trademarks which are registered in the united states and in numerous foreign countries. widely recognized throughout north america south and central america and europe these registered trademarks along with osterizerregistered trademark mixmasterregistered trademark toast logicregistered trademark steammasterregistered trademark oskarregistered trademark grillmasterregistered trademark and blanket with a brainregistered trademark brands are important to the success of the company's products. other important trademarks within sunbeam include oster designerregistered trademark line cuddleupregistered trademark and aregistered trademark. sunbeam holds numerous patents covering a wide variety of products the loss of any one of which would not have a material adverse effect on the company's business taken as a whole. employees the company currently has approximately fulltime domestic employees and international employees. none of the company's domestic fulltime workforce has union representation. sunbeam has had no material laborrelated work stoppages and in the opinion of management relations with its employees are generally good. seasonality on a consolidated basis sunbeam sales do not exhibit substantial seasonality. however sales of outdoor cooking products are strongest in the first half of the year while sales of appliances and personal care and comfort products are strongest in the second half of the year. in addition sales of a number of the company's products including warming blankets vaporizers humidifiers and grills may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions. during the company initiated early buy programs for highly seasonal products such as grills and warming blankets in order to more levelize production and distribution activities. raw materials the raw materials used in the manufacture of the company's products are available from numerous suppliers in quantities sufficient to meet normal requirements. the company's primary raw materials include aluminum steel resin copper and corrugated cardboard for cartons. environmental matters the company's operations like those of comparable businesses are subject to certain federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in addition to laws and regulations regarding labeling and packaging of products and the sale of products containing certain environmentally sensitive materials environmental laws. the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all environmental laws which are applicable to its operations. compliance with environmental laws involves certain continuing costs however such costs of ongoing compliance have not resulted and are not anticipated to result in a material increase in the company's capital expenditures or to have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations financial condition or competitive position. in addition to ongoing environmental compliance at its operations the company also is actively engaged in certain environmental remediation activities relating primarily to divested operations. as of december the company had been identified by the united states environmental protection agency epa or a state environmental agency as a potentially responsible party prp in connection with seven sites subject to the federal superfund law and two sites subject to state superfund laws comparable to the federal law collectively the environmental sites exclusive of sites at which the company has been designated or expects to be designated as a de minimis less than participant. the superfund act and related state environmental remediation laws generally authorize governmental authorities to remediate a superfund site and to assess the costs against the prps or to order the prps to remediate the site at their expense. liability under the superfund law is joint and several and is imposed on a strict basis without regard to degree of negligence or culpability. as a result the company recognizes its responsibility to determine whether other prps at a superfund site are financially capable of paying their respective shares of the ultimate cost of remediation of the site. whenever the company has determined that a particular prp is not financially responsible it has assumed for purposes of establishing reserve amounts that such prp will not pay its respective share of the costs of remediation. to minimize the company's potential liability with respect to the environmental sites the company has actively participated in steering committees and other groups of prps established with respect to such sites. the company currently is engaged in active remediation activities at nine sites four of which are among the environmental sites referred to above and five of which have not been designated as superfund sites under federal or state law. in addition the company is engaged in environmental remediation activities at a site located in newburgh heights ohio where a subsidiary formerly conducted operations. the company has been actively cooperating with the united states nuclear regulatory commission and state regulatory authorities in developing and implementing a plan for remediation of this site which remediation is anticipated to be substantially completed in . the company's costs for environmental remediation activities have not had a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations financial condition or competitive position. the company has established reserves to cover the anticipated probable costs of remediation based upon periodic reviews of all sites for which the company has or may have remediation responsibility. as of december the amount of such reserves was approximately four percent of the company's total liabilities as set forth in the consolidated financial statements. such environmental reserves do not anticipate any offsets for potential insurance recoveries from certain of the company's liability insurance carriers which the company continues to pursue. due to uncertainty over the remedial measures to be adopted at some sites the possibility of changes in the environmental laws and the fact that joint and several liability with the right of contribution is possible at federal and state superfund sites the company's ultimate future liability with respect to sites at which remediation has not been completed may vary from the amounts reserved at fiscal year end . however the company believes based on existing information that the costs of completing the environmental remediation of all sites for which the company has a remediation responsibility have been adequately reserved and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the company's financial condition. in december the company reached a negotiated settlement with the epa with regard to a notice of violation concerning the construction and operation of two paint lines at the company's neosho mo facility prior to obtaining the necessary permits for construction and operation. the negotiated settlement amount of recognizes the benefits of a supplemental environmental project which consisted of the company's installation of nominal emission powder coating lines to replace solvent paint lines. in october the company executed a consent decree documenting the settlement and is awaiting the epa's execution of the consent decree the company anticipates formal resolution of this matter by the second quarter of . the company is not a party to any other administrative or judicial proceeding to which a governmental authority is a party and which involves potential monetary sanctions exclusive of interest and costs of or more. cautionary statements certain of the information contained herein including management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking information as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of as the same may be amended herein the act and in releases made by the securities and exchange commission sec from time to time. such forwardlooking information may in included herein under the following captions among others item . businessrestructuring and growth plan pending acquisitions international competitive strengths customers raw materials environmental matters and item management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation. these cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the act with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the act. the company cautions investors that any forwardlooking statements made by the company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements as a result of various factors. bullet the company believes that it has sufficient management resources to complete the pending acquisitions of coleman signature brands and first alert without negatively impacting on the company's ongoing operations. in addition the company expects to benefit from various operating synergies arising from these acquisitions. if the company fails to maintain its current operations in the manner anticipated or fails to obtain the expected operating synergies such failures could negatively effect the company's financial andor operating performance which effect could be material. bullet the company expects to significantly increase the amount of its outstanding indebtedness and to enter into financing arrangements which may contain various restrictive covenants in order to finance the acquisitions of coleman signature brands and first alert. the continuing cost of servicing such debt could negatively effect the company's future operations which effect could be material. bullet the company's performance should be expected to be affected by the strength of the retail economy primarily in the united states but also in canada latin america and asia. weakness in consumer confidence and retail outlets including the financial weakness or bankruptcy of retail outlets especially mass merchants should be expected to adversely impact the company's future financial results. in addition the extended credit terms provided by the company in connection with its early buy program increase the company's risk of collection of accounts receivable. bullet the company operates in a highly competitive environment with numerous competitors which are financially strong and capable of competing effectively with the company in the marketplace. such competitors may take actions to meet the company's new product introductions and other initiatives. some competitors may be willing to accept lower margins and to reduce prices to compete with the company. as a result the company could fail to achieve anticipated sales increases to realize anticipated price increases or otherwise fail to meet its anticipated goals. any of such circumstances would likely have an adverse effect on future financial performance which effect could be material. bullet the company currently manufactures approximately of its products. one of the company's goals for is to source approximately of the company's parts andor products from third parties. the company's ability to realize sales and operating profits at anticipated levels is dependent upon its ability to timely manufacture source and deliver products which may be sold for a profit. labor difficulties delays in delivery or pricing of raw materials andor sourced products scheduling and transportation difficulties management dislocations and delays in development and manufacture of new products can negatively affect operating profits. although the company will use its best efforts to select suppliers for sourced product which are reliable and dependable the company's planned increase in the percentage of sourced products will decrease the company's immediate control of product and if such suppliers fail to deliver products as anticipated could have an adverse effect on future financial performance which effect could be material. bullet as a consumer goods distributor the company's results of operations can be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits product recall actions andor by higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. bullet the company expects to substantially increase the amount of business conducted by it outside north america. if the company fails to achieve anticipated market penetration in areas of the world into which the company currently expects to expand its sales such event is likely to have an adverse effect on the company's future financial performance which effect could be material. expansion of the company's sales in foreign markets depends upon many factors including the states of economies in foreign countries the strength of consumer demand in those countries for products which the company sells or expects to sell in those markets the strength of competition from other global consumer products companies and other factors which may negatively affect the company's anticipated performance in those markets. although the recent financial instability in asia has not currently had any material impact on the company if such conditions continue andor worsen they could negatively impact the company's ability to achieve anticipated sales growth in such countries the effect of which could be material to the company's future financial performance. bullet the company currently manufactures some products and has sales in such economies as those of mexico and venezuela both of which economies have been unstable or hyperinflationary in recent years. the economies of other foreign countries important to the company's expansion plans including other countries in latin america and asia could suffer similar instability in the future. such factors as currency devaluations new tariffs changes in monetary policies inflation governmental instability and similar matters could negatively affect the company's anticipated performance in foreign markets. although the company plans to take advantage of recent economic and currency fluctuations in certain asian countries by increasing the company's purchases of products from such countries at lower prices there is no guarantee that such purchasing advantage will be fulfilled or will fully overcome any lost sales opportunities in those same countries. as a result the economic conditions discussed above or any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on future financial performance which effect could be material. bullet a significant portion of the cost of goods manufactured by the company in north america is the cost of raw materials andor components. the company has implemented changes in its purchasing function which have enabled the company to purchase materials more efficiently and economically than it has in the past. the future success of the company's purchasing initiatives may be affected by many factors beyond the company's control such as commodity pricing generally and higher prices for the specific materials required by the company. although there are numerous suppliers available for the materials and components sourced by the company any unanticipated change in suppliers could be disruptive and costly to the company. in addition the company's future initiatives to reduce the cost of materials simply may not achieve savings in amounts comparable to those previously obtained by the company. a significant failure by the company to maintain material costs as anticipated would likely have an adverse effect on anticipated future financial performance which effect could be material. bullet the company anticipates realizing price increases from time to time for certain of its products. the company operates in a highly competitive industry and its ability to realize price increases may be limited due to competitive pressures. if there is a material failure to realize anticipated price increases margins likely will be lower than anticipated by the company and this will likely have an adverse effect on future financial performance which effect could be material. bullet the company anticipates that it will be able

contingencies environmental matters the company's operations like those of comparable businesses are subject to certain federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. as of december the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party prp in connection with seven sites subject to the federal superfund law and two sites subject to state superfund laws comparable to the federal law collectively the environmental sites exclusive of sites at which the company has been designated or expects to be designated as a de minimis less than participant. substantially all of these sites relate to divested operations of the company. the company currently is engaged in active remediation activities at nine sites four of which are among the environmental sites referred to above and five of which have not been designated as superfund sites under federal or state law. in addition the company is engaged in environmental remediation activities at a site

operations. the company has been actively cooperating with the united states nuclear regulatory commission and state regulatory authorities in developing a plan for remediation of this site which remediation is expected to be substantially completed during . the company has established reserves in accordance with sfas no. accounting for contingencies to cover the anticipated probable costs of remediation based upon periodic reviews of all sites for which the company has or may have remediation responsibility. as of december the amount of such reserves was less than of the company's total liabilities as set forth in the consolidated financial statements. liability under the superfund law is joint and several and is imposed on a strict basis without regard to degree of negligence or culpability. as a result the company recognizes its responsibility to determine whether other prp's at a superfund site are financially capable of paying their respective shares of the ultimate cost of remediation of the site. whenever the company has determined that a particular prp is not financially responsible it has assumed for purposes of establishing reserve amounts that such prp will not pay its respective share of the costs of remediation. to minimize the company's potential liability with respect to the environmental sites the company has actively participated in steering committees and other groups of prp's established with respect to such sites. the company continues to pursue the recovery of some environmental remediation costs from certain of its liability insurance carriers however such potential recoveries have not been offset against potential liabilities and have not been considered in determining the company's environmental reserves. due to uncertainty over remedial measures to be adopted at some sites the possibility of changes in environmental laws and regulations and the fact that joint and several liability with the right of contribution is possible at federal and state superfund sites the company's ultimate future liability with respect to sites at which remediation has not been completed may vary from the amounts reserved as of december . in connection with the company's restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of a comprehensive review of all environmental exposures was performed and the company accelerated its strategy for the resolution and settlement of certain environmental claims. as a result the company recorded additional environmental reserves of approximately million in the fourth quarter of . the company believes based on existing information that the costs of completing environmental remediation of all sites for which the company has a remediation responsibility have been adequately reserved and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the company's financial condition. leases the company rents certain facilities equipment and retail stores under operating leases. rental expense for operating leases amounted to million in million for and million for . the minimum future rentals due under noncancelable operating leases as of december aggregated million. the amounts payable in each of the years and thereafter are million million million million million and million respectively. certain debt obligations responsibility for servicing certain debt obligations of the company's predecessor were assumed by third parties in connection with the acquisition of former businesses although the company's predecessor remained the primary obligor in accordance with the respective loan documents. such f sunbeam corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued . commitments and contingenciescontinued obligations which amounted to approximately million at december and the corresponding receivables from the third parties are not included in the consolidated balance sheets since these transactions occurred prior

aggregating million were outstanding as of december . litigation the company is involved in various lawsuits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business or and related to divested operations of the company. the company has established reserves in accordance with sfas no. accounting for contingencies to cover the anticipated probable costs of litigation matters based upon periodic reviews of all cases. the company believes based on existing information that anticipated probable costs of litigation matters have been adequately reserved and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the company's financial condition. product liability matters the company is party to various personal injury and property damage lawsuits relating to its products and incidental to its business. annually the company sets its product liability insurance program based on the company's current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance. the company's program for was comprised of a selfinsurance retention of million per occurrence. cumulative amounts estimated to be payable by the company with respect to pending and potential claims for all years in which the company is liable under its selfinsurance retention have been accrued as liabilities. such accrued liabilities are necessarily based on estimates which include actuarial determinations made by independent actuarial consultants as to liability exposure taking into account prior experience numbers of claims and other relevant factors thus the company's ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the amounts accrued. the methods of making such estimates and establishing the resulting liability are reviewed continually and any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in current operating results. historically product liability awards have rarely exceeded the company's individual per occurrence selfinsured retention. there can be no assurance however that the company's future product liability experience will be consistent with its past experience. based on existing information the company believes that the ultimate conclusion of the various pending product liability claims and lawsuits of the company individually or in the aggregate will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company. f sunbeam corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued . unaudited quarterly financial data fiscal a fiscal a a each quarter
